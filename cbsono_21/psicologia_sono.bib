	abstract = {Research shows that dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions play an important role in the development, maintenance and exacerbation of insomnia. This study examines the factorial validity, psychometric properties and both concurrent and predictive validity of the German version of the 16-item DBAS (dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep) scale. Data was collected in 864 vocational students from the German-speaking part of Switzerland (43\% females, Mage = 17.9 years). Data collection took place twice within a 10-month interval. The students completed a German translation of the DBAS-16, the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and provided information about their psychological functioning. Descriptive statistics, factorial validity, internal consistency, gender differences, concurrent, and predictive validity were examined. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the 4-factor structure of the DBAS-16. All factors (consequences, worry/helplessness, expectations, medication) were positively correlated and had acceptable psychometric properties. Females reported higher scores across all DBAS measures. Weak-to-moderate correlations were found between dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs, insomnia and poor sleep quality. Dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs were also associated with decreased psychological functioning, and consistently predicted insomnia and poor psychological functioning at follow-up, even after controlling for socio-demographic background and baseline levels. The present study provides support for the validity and psychometric properties of the German version of the DBAS-16. Most importantly, it corroborates the relevance of cognitive-emotional factors in the onset and maintenance of insomnia and psychological symptoms among young people.},

We aimed to examine which version and which subscales had better psychometric properties.Methods:Data were derived from a randomized controlled trial of internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) vs. waitlist in 312 participants with self-report diagnosis of insomnia disorder. The response distribution, internal consistency, construct and concurrent validity, and sensitivity to change were analyzed.Results:Floor or ceiling effects were found in 19 of the 30 DBAS items. Item-total correlation was {\textless} 0.30 in 43.3\%, 31.3\%, and 10.0\% of the items in DBAS-30, DBAS-16, DBAS-10. Internal consistency was satisfactory for total scores, with Cronbach α ranging from 0.73–0.81, but 2 subscales of DBAS-30 and 1 subscale of DBAS-10 had Cronbach α {\textless} 0.35. Factor analysis produced 8, 4, and 3 factors for DBAS-30, DBAS-16, and DBAS-10. Only the factor structure of DBAS-16 was compatible with previous studies. Concurrent validity with insomnia, anxiety, and depressive symptoms was much stronger than with sleep diary parameters. Sensitivities to change of the DBAS scores following CBT-I and with sleep improvement were found, except the DBAS-30 “attributions” subscale and DBAS-16 “medication” subscale.Conclusions:The DBAS-16 possesses better internal consistency, a reproducible factor structure, strong concurrent validity, and sensitivity to change, and therefore is recommended for research use. The DBAS-30 and DBAS-10 have their own strengths, but there are limitations in their application as a quantitative measure in research.Citation:Chung KF, Ho FY, Yeung WF.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of two existing attributional scales. Methods: Data are presented from 178 clinic attending insomniacs who completed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS) and the Sleep Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ). Standard procedures for the psychometric evaluation of scales were adopted. Results: The internal consistency of the DBAS (30 items) was reasonable (Cronbach's α = 0.72); however, a revised ten-item short form (DBAS-10) demonstrated a more robust principal component structure than the original scale (three relatively “pure” factors explained 55\% of the variance). The derived subscales achieved satisfactory internal consistency, and the DBAS-10 demonstrated treatment-related measurement sensitivity. The DBAS-10, nevertheless, correlated highly (r = 0.826) with the DBAS. A four-factor solution for the SDQ is also presented (61\% explained variance) with α = 0.67. Internal consistency of these subscales ranged from 0.59 to 0.82. The association between the SDQ and DBAS-10 was modest (r = 0.28), suggesting that the scales have some independence. Conclusions: The scales offer potential for clinical and research work on insomnia and possible applications are discussed.},

Beliefs, sleep, insomnia symptoms, and sleep-related psychosocial impairment were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up. Greater change in dysfunctional beliefs occurring over the course of BT, CT, or CBT was associated with greater improvement in insomnia symptoms and impairment at posttreatment and both follow-ups. All groups experienced a significant decrease in dysfunctional beliefs during treatment, which were sustained through 6- and 12-month follow-up. Compared with the BT group, a greater proportion of participants in the CT and/or CBT groups endorsed dysfunctional beliefs below a level considered clinically significant at posttreatment and 12-month follow-up. The results demonstrate the importance of targeting dysfunctional beliefs in insomnia treatment, suggest that beliefs may be significantly modified with BT alone, and indicate that cognitive interventions may be particularly powerful in enhancing belief change.},

Population: Two hundred and eleven (69 normal sleepers; 142 insomnia suffers) middle-aged and older adults (age 40–79 years) drawn from two separate cohorts of research volunteers. Method: Volunteers in the first cohort (69 normal sleepers; 69 insomnia sufferers) completed the full DBAS on one occasion. Volunteers in the second cohort (73 insomnia sufferers) completed the full DBAS prior to treatment and at multiple subsequent time points to assess treatment-related changes. A series of statistical tests were conducted with one or both cohorts to investigate the comparability of the DBAS-10 and full DBAS, the internal consistency of each instrument, the factor structure of the DBAS-10, and the validity of this instrument. Results: Statistical findings showed that the DBAS-10 correlated highly with the full DBAS, had respectable internal consistency, effectively discriminated normal sleepers from insomnia sufferers, and detected cognitive changes resulting specifically from CBT intervention. Although factor analysis empirically identified three conceptually meaningful DBAS-10 subscales, the subscale structure varied somewhat from previous factor analytic findings with this instrument. Conclusions: The DBAS-10 generally appears to have very acceptable psychometric properties although subscales previously proposed for this instrument may vary across research populations.

	abstract = {Introduction
Previous studies have shown that psychological interventions do not only improve patients' mental symptoms (i.e., true change) but may also change the internal standards patients use to evaluate their symptoms (i.e., response shifts). Although the response shifts could reflect patients’ cognitive changes toward their disorders as the interventions aim to achieve, failing to differentiate them from the true change during data analyses could bias the research conclusions. Considering this issue is seldom discussed in sleep studies, this study thus examined the impacts of response-shift items in an intervention study of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) via empirical-data based simulations.
Method
We used longitudinal measurement invariance tests to identify the items in an abbreviated version of the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale that are non-invariant (response shifted) against CBT-I based on data from 114 insomnia patients. The partial invariance model built accordingly was then used as a population model for simulations to examine the impacts of the response-shift items on follow-up paired t-tests.
Results
Invariance tests indicate CBT-I would lift the intercept of one item in DBAS-10 and cause non-uniform calibrations in three items. The following up simulations showed that failing to exclude the intercept-lifted item from the calculations of the subscale scores would lower the probability of using paired t-test to correctly detect the treatment effect by up to 53\%.
Conclusions
We recommend sleep researchers to consider the issues of response-shift when assessing sleep-related constructs in interventional studies for insomnia.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to exam the degree to which cognitive-behavioral insomnia therapy (CBT) reduces dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and to determine if such cognitive changes correlate with sleep improvements.
DESIGN: The study used a double-blind, placebo-controlled design in which participants were randomized to CBT, progressive muscle relaxation training or a sham behavioral intervention. Each treatment was provided in 6 weekly, 30-60-minute individual therapy sessions.
SETTING: The sleep disorders center of a large university medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-five individuals (ages 40 to 80 years of age) who met strict criteria for persistent primary sleep-maintenance insomnia were enrolled in this trial.
INTERVENTIONS: N/A.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Participants completed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep (DBAS) Scale, as well as other assessment procedures before treatment, shortly after treatment, and at a six-month follow-up. Items composing a factor-analytically derived DBAS short form (DBAS-SF) were then used to compare treatment groups across time points. Results showed CBT produced larger changes on the DBAS-SF than did the other treatments, and these changes endured through the follow-up period. Moreover, these cognitive changes were correlated with improvements noted on both objective and subjective measures of insomnia symptoms, particularly within the CBT group.
CONCLUSIONS: CBT is effective for reducing dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and such changes are associated with other positive outcomes in insomnia treatment.},

	abstract = {Study objectives: This study aimed to develop a scale utilizing the original Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS) scale that measured maladaptive cognitions associated with sleep that is especially sensitive to cancer patients. In addition to the original scale, we added two additional items that reflected cancer-specific dysfunctional beliefs about sleep. Methods: Participants consisted of 337 cancer patients (mean age 54.0 ± 11.8 years, 32.0\% men). All participants completed the DBAS-16, two cancer specific items, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Item-to-total-score correlations, internal consistency, item selection, and factor structure were examined. Results: The DBAS-16 was found to be reliable, and internal consistency was also adequate when adding two cancer-specific questions (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89). A total of 14 items were selected, and a four-factor model was selected using exploratory factor analysis (Tucker-Lewis index = 0.86, root mean square error of approximation = 0.08). The four factors were (a) sleep expectations, (b) worry about insomnia, (c) perceived consequences of insomnia and medication, and (d) two cancer-related items. The modified 14 items of the Cancer-related DBAS (C-DBAS-14) well differentiated cancer patients with and without insomnia. Conclusions: The C-DBAS-14 is a promising measure that has adequate internal consistency. It is also sensitive to sleep-related cognitions in cancer patients and can discriminate patients with cancer who are experiencing insomnia from those who are good sleepers. The enhanced utility of the shortened 14-item scale tailored specifically to cancer patients may be useful in both clinical practice and research settings.Abbreviations: CBT: cognitive behavioral therapy; C-DBAS-14: Cancer-Related Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitude about Sleep; C-DBS: Cancer-Related Dysfunctional Beliefs about Sleep; DBAS-16: Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep; ISI: Insomnia Severity Index.},

Methods Objective insomnia was defined by meeting 1 of the following criteria: sleep onset latency {\textgreater}30 minutes (sleep initiating insomnia), wake after sleep onset lasting {\textgreater}30 minutes (sleep maintenance insomnia), total sleep time {\textless}360 minutes and a terminal wakefulness {\textgreater}30 minutes (insomnia with too short duration of sleep or early morning awakening), or a combination of the previous quantitative criteria (mixed disorder). Using validated questionnaires based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria, subjective insomnia was categorized into 3 groups: good sleepers, insomnia symptoms, and DSM-IV insomnia. Results A total of 1,042 subjects participated in the study (95\% response rate). The prevalence of objective insomnia was 32\%. The subjective prevalence of insomnia symptoms was 45\%, and the subjective prevalence of DSM-IV insomnia was 15\%. Sociodemographic factors were similar in both the objective insomnia and the DSM-IV insomnia groups. Age, but not psychiatric symptoms, was predictive of objective insomnia. The subjective criteria were not adequately sensitive (36\%) to identify objective insomnia, but were adequately specific (77\%) to rule out polysomnography noninsomnia. Interpretation The prevalence of objective insomnia assessed by polysomnography was higher than the prevalence of subjective insomnia according to DSM-IV–validated questionnaires.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite many studies, the impact of chronic insomnia on daytime functioning is not well understood. The aim of our study was to detect this impact by evaluating quality of life (QoL) using a validated instrument, the 36-item Short Form Health Survey of the Medical Outcomes Study (SF-36), in three matched groups of severe insomniacs, mild insomniacs, and good sleepers selected from the general population.
METHODS: Three matched groups of 240 severe insomniacs, 422 mild insomniacs, and 391 good sleepers were recruited from the general French population after eliminating those with DSM-IV criteria for anxiety or depression. All subjects were asked to complete the SF-36. Scores for each QoL dimension were calculated and compared statistically among the three groups.
RESULTS: Severe insomniacs had lower QoL scores in eight dimensions of the SF-36 than mild insomniacs and good sleepers. Mild insomniacs had lower scores in the same eight dimensions when compared with good sleepers. No dimension was significantly more altered than the other.
CONCLUSIONS: The mental health status and role of emotional QoL dimensions were worse in severe and mild insomniacs than in good sleepers. This result held even though we screened for psychiatric diseases, which shows a clear interrelation between insomnia and emotional state. General health status was also worse in severe and mild insomniacs than in good sleepers. However, we could conclude only that insomnia was related to a worse health status and not whether it was a cause or consequence of this worse health status. Finally, the degradation of QoL scores was correlated with the severity of insomnia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Individuals with insomnia consistently report difficulties pertaining to their cognitive functioning (e.g., memory, concentration). However, objective measurements of their performance on neuropsychological tests have produced inconsistent findings. This meta-analysis was conducted to provide a quantitative summary of evidence regarding the magnitude of differences between individuals with primary insomnia and normal sleepers on a broad range of neuropsychological measures.
METHODS: Reference databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Dissertation Abstracts International) were searched for studies comparing adults with primary insomnia to normal sleepers on neuropsychological measures. Dependent variables related to cognitive and psychomotor performance were extracted from each study. Variables were classified independently by two licensed neuropsychologists according to the main cognitive function being measured. Individual effect sizes (Cohen's d) were weighted by variability and combined for each cognitive function using a fixed effects model. Average effect sizes and their 95\% confidence intervals were computed for each cognitive function.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria, for a total of 639 individuals with insomnia and 558 normal sleepers. Significant impairments (p{\textless}0.05) of small to moderate magnitude were found in individuals with insomnia for tasks assessing episodic memory (ES = -0.51), problem solving (ES = -0.42), manipulation in working memory (ES = -0.42), and retention in working memory (ES = -0.22). No significant group differences were observed for tasks assessing general cognitive function, perceptual and psychomotor processes, procedural learning, verbal functions, different dimensions of attention (alertness, complex reaction time, speed of information processing, selective attention, sustained attention/vigilance) and some aspects of executive functioning (verbal fluency, cognitive flexibility).
CONCLUSION: Individuals with insomnia exhibit performance impairments for several cognitive functions, including working memory, episodic memory and some aspects of executive functioning. While the data suggests that these impairments are of small to moderate magnitude, further research using more ecologically valid measures and normative data are warranted to establish their clinical significance.},

	abstract = {Objective
The aim of the present study was to examine the association of insomnia symptoms with demographic and physical and mental conditions in a large population-based study.
Methods
Cross-sectional data on insomnia and comorbid conditions were gathered from 47,700 individuals aged 20–89 in Norway. Comorbid conditions included anxiety and depression and the following physical conditions: asthma, allergy, cancer, hypertension, diabetes, migraine, headache, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia rheumatoid arthritis, arthrosis, Bechterew's disease, musculoskeletal disorders, and obesity (body mass index {\textgreater}30).
Results
Insomnia symptoms were found in 13.5\% of the population and were more prevalent among women, older adults, and in individuals with less education. Reporting insomnia symptoms significantly increased the associations with a range of conditions, especially mental conditions, pain conditions with uncertain etiology and, to a lesser extent, chronic pain conditions. These findings remained significant also when adjusting for a range of potential confounders, whereas the association between insomnia and somatic conditions was largely reduced to a nonsignificant level in the fully adjusted analyses.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that insomnia symptoms are associated with a range of different conditions. The findings suggest that the independent contribution of insomnia is strongest on conditions characterized by some level of psychological or psychosomatic properties.},

Greater understanding of the pathophysiology of insomnia may provide important information regarding how, and under what conditions, the disorder develops and is maintained as well as potential targets for prevention and treatment. The aims of this report are (1) to summarize current knowledge on the pathophysiology of insomnia and (2) to present a model of the pathophysiology of insomnia that considers evidence from various domains of research. Working within several models of insomnia, evidence for the pathophysiology of the disorder is presented across levels of analysis, from genetic to molecular and cellular mechanisms, neural circuitry, physiologic mechanisms, sleep behavior, and self-report. We discuss the role of hyperarousal as an overarching theme that guides our conceptualization of insomnia. Finally, we propose a model of the pathophysiology of insomnia that integrates the various types of evidence presented.},

A pilot study of the conditioning of rapid sleep onset with the aid of a hypnotic provides a preliminary demonstration of the application of conditioning to the pharmacotherapy of sleep. It is predicted that the commonly accepted view of sleep latency as solely reflecting physiological sleep tendency, will require modification to include the effects of conditioning. The current pattern of hypnotic usage, an issue of widespread concern, is subjected to a behavioral analysis based on a new model of conditioned tolerance.

	abstract = {Psychophysiologic insomnia (PI) is the most common form of persistent primary insomnia. Its 'behavioral phenotype', comprising elements such as conditioned arousal, sleep-incompatible behavior and sleep preoccupation, has not changed markedly across several generations of diagnostic nosology. Moreover, a substantial outcome literature demonstrates that PI can be treated effectively using a range of psychological interventions. It seems evident that behavioral and cognitive factors play a part. What is less clear is exactly how PI develops and what are its crucial maintaining factors. This paper proposes an explanatory model, that we call the attention-intention-effort pathway. The argument is that sleep normalcy is a relatively automatic process. Consequently, it is vulnerable, and may be inhibited, by focused attention and by direct attempts to control its expression. Drawing upon parallels in the literature on adult psychopathology, and upon recent clinical and experimental studies on insomnia, the evidence for this pathway is considered and a research agenda is outlined. In particular, computerized tests of cognitive bias are seen as offering an objective means of appraising mental processes in insomnia. These may be applied concurrently with somatic measurements in future studies to better understand this common psycho-physiologic condition.},

	abstract = {Cognitive models of insomnia have received growing support in recent years and are embraced by the current diagnostic framework. Many people with insomnia report that mental events, such as intrusive thoughts or a racing mind, prevent them from achieving or maintaining sleep. Dysfunctional cognition may play an important role in perpetuating insomnia, with many individuals with psychophysiological insomnia reporting a distorted perception of sleep. Neurocognitive studies have indicated that high-frequency EEG activity associated with cognitive processes is enhanced in patients with insomnia at or around sleep onset, which may distort the individual's judgement about sleep initiation and duration. A subtype of psychophysiological insomnia has been proposed – attention–intention–effort (AIE) syndrome – that takes into consideration the interaction between behavioral and cognitive factors in the development and maintenance of insomnia. A series of studies from the University of Glasgow Sleep Centre using cognitive probe tasks has provided insight into this pathway, particularly with regard to the role of attention bias towards sleep stimuli in mediating insomnia. Further research is required to explore the cortical correlates of attention bias, investigate AIE as a potential causal mechanism of insomnia and examine AIE in other insomnia groups.},

First, it is argued that sleep is facilitated by cognitive deactivation, with less controlled information processing as compared with daytime functioning, and correspondingly more acceptance of spontaneously occurring physiological and mental processes. Second, it is argued that mindfulness practice, in the form of nonjudgmental observation of spontaneously occurring physical and psychological processes, may be an effective way of training the skills of cognitive deactivation. As a complement, psychoeducational methods are advocated to help the client develop a more functional schematic model of sleep and sleeplessness.},

	abstract = {Insomnia is a major public health problem considering its high prevalence, impact on daily life, co-morbidity with other disorders and societal costs. Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBTI) is currently considered to be the preferred treatment. However, no meta-analysis exists of all studies using at least one component of CBTI for insomnia, which also uses modern techniques to pool data and to analyze subgroups of patients. We included 87 randomized controlled trials, comparing 118 treatments (3724 patients) to non-treated controls (2579 patients). Overall, the interventions had significant effects on: insomnia severity index (g = 0.98), sleep efficiency (g = 0.71), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (g = 0.65), wake after sleep onset (g = 0.63) and sleep onset latency (SOL; g = 0.57), number of awakenings (g = 0.29) and sleep quality (g = 0.40). The smallest effect was on total sleep time (g = 0.16). Face-to-face treatments of at least four sessions seem to be more effective than self-help interventions or face-to-face interventions with fewer sessions. Otherwise the results seem to be quite robust (similar for patients with or without comorbid disease, younger or older patients, using or not using sleep medication). We conclude that CBTI, either its components or the full package, is effective in the treatment of insomnia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the unique contribution of behavior therapy (BT) and cognitive therapy (CT) relative to the full cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for persistent insomnia.
METHOD: Participants were 188 adults (117 women; M age = 47.4 years, SD = 12.6) with persistent insomnia (average of 14.5 years duration). They were randomized to 8 weekly, individual sessions consisting of BT (n = 63), CT (n = 65), or CBT (n = 60).
RESULTS: Full CBT was associated with greatest improvements, the improvements associated with BT were faster but not as sustained and the improvements associated with CT were slower and sustained. The proportion of treatment responders was significantly higher in the CBT (67.3\%) and BT (67.4\%) relative to CT (42.4\%) groups at post treatment, while 6 months later CT made significant further gains (62.3\%), BT had significant loss (44.4\%), and CBT retained its initial response (67.6\%). Remission rates followed a similar trajectory, with higher remission rates at post treatment in CBT (57.3\%) relative to CT (30.8\%), with BT falling in between (39.4\%); CT made further gains from post treatment to follow up (30.9\% to 51.6\%). All 3 therapies produced improvements of daytime functioning at both post treatment and follow up, with few differential changes across groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Full CBT is the treatment of choice. Both BT and CT are effective, with a more rapid effect for BT and a delayed action for CT. These different trajectories of changes provide unique insights into the process of behavior change via behavioral versus cognitive routes.},

A sample of 281 primary insomnia sufferers completed items comprising the Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep scale (DBAS-16). Their resultant scores on the four DBAS-16 subscales were then subjected to a cluster analysis, which resulted in the identiﬁcation of four distinctive age-matched subgroups. Two subgroups were characterized by pathologically elevated scores on at least two of the DBAS-16 subscales, whereas the other two subgroups had subscale scores that closely resembled those of a normative sample. Subsequent comparisons showed the insomnia subgroups differed in regard to their insomnia severity, use of prescribed medication for sleep, depression and anxiety symptoms, and daytime sleepiness. Furthermore, comparisons of treatment outcomes (i.e. analysis of change scores and normative comparisons) across clusters showed that the subgroups did not beneﬁt equally from a standardized form of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for insomnia. Findings demonstrate the contribution of speciﬁc sleep-related beliefs on presenting insomnia symptoms and suggest the potential usefulness of tailoring CBT protocols to match the needs of distinctive insomnia subtypes.},

	abstract = {Study Objective: Sleep related cognitions (e.g., faulty beliefs and appraisals, unrealistic expectations, perceptual and attention bias) play an important role in perpetuating insomnia. This paper presents new psychometric data on an abbreviated version of the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-16), a 16-item self-report measure designed to evaluate a subset of those sleep related cognitions. Design: Psychometric study of a patient-reported measure of sleep related beliefs based on existing clinical and research databases. Participants: A total of 283 individuals (60\% women; mean age of 46.6 years old) with insomnia, including 124 clinical patients and 159 research participants. Measurements and Results: Participants completed the DBAS, Insomnia Severity Index, Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories, daily sleep diaries for 2 weeks, and 3 nights of polysomnography (research sample only) as part of a baseline assessment. The DBAS-16 was found to be reliable, as evidenced by adequate internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.77 for clinical and 0.79 for research samples) and temporal stability (r = 0.83). The factor structure was similar to the original 30-item version, with 4 factors emerging and reﬂecting: (a) perceived consequences of insomnia, (b) worry/helplessness about insomnia, (c) sleep expectations, and (d) medication. DBAS total scores were signiﬁcantly correlated with other self-report measures of insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression, but not with speciﬁc sleep parameters. Conclusion: The psychometric qualities of this abbreviated DBAS-16 version seem adequate. This patient-reported measure should prove a useful instrument to evaluate the role of sleep related beliefs and attitudes in insomnia and to monitor change on this cognitive variable as a potential moderator of treatment outcome.},

Insomnia is a highly prevalent and distressing disorder, associated with many adverse outcomes. Although extensive work has focused on the cognitive-behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I), few studies have directly examined the mechanisms of this intervention. CBT-I is a short-term, multi-component treatment that has demonstrated strong efficacy in treating insomnia. The purpose of the present study is: (a) to investigate if CBT-I works in accordance with its proposed mechanisms, and (b) to evaluate how the field is progressing in its understanding of these processes. This study comprehensively reviewed CBT-I RCTs for their inclusion of mediator variables. Secondary analysis studies were also surveyed for relevant mediator variables. Results demonstrated that 21 RCTs (39\% of the total RCTs) and 11 secondary analysis studies examined at least one of the proposed mediators. Results of this review highlight that, although CBT-I appears to be targeting the hypothesized sleep processes, more research is needed to better understand whether CBT-I works in accordance with its theorized mechanisms. Inclusion of mediational analyses in future RCTs and secondary analysis studies would allow for further refinement of CBT-I and improved treatment outcomes.},

We conducted a meta-analysis focusing on these issues. We identified 14 randomized controlled studies published between 1990 and 2009 that fulfilled our selection criteria. Intra-group comparison of CBT-I and comparison between CBT-I and control groups were performed on these studies. The intra-group comparison revealed that the effect sizes of CBT-I for subjective sleep variables from sleep diaries were medium to large at the end point of treatment, and these effect sizes were favorably maintained on follow-up. A between-group comparison revealed that CBT-I was more effective than the control for subjective sleep variables at the end of treatment and that its effectiveness was also recognized on follow-up. With regard to self-rating scales, as compared to the control group, the effect sizes in the CBT-I group were medium to large both at the end of treatment and on follow-up. However, there were problems of publication bias in some of the subjective or objective sleep variables. The abovementioned results support the effectiveness of CBT-I for the treatment and prevention of relapse of primary insomnia despite the existence of a certain publication bias.},

These protocols involved two baseline nights (9-h time-in-bed [TIB]), 5 nights of sleep manipulation, 2 recovery nights (9-h TIB), followed by a second cycle of sleep manipulation (3 nights) and recovery (2 nights). Cognitive performance, subjective sleepiness, and mood were evaluated daily; sleep was assessed using polysomnography.Splitting 6.5 h of sleep with a mid-afternoon nap offered a boost to cognitive function compared to continuous nocturnal sleep. However, when total TIB across 24 h increased to 8 h, the split and continuous sleep groups performed comparably in tests evaluating vigilance, working memory, executive function, processing speed, subjective sleepiness, and mood.In adolescents, the effects of split sleep on basic cognitive functions vary by the amount of total sleep obtained. As long as the total sleep opportunity across 24 h is within the recommended range, students may fulfill sleep requirements by adopting a split sleep schedule consisting of a shorter period of nocturnal sleep combined with a mid-afternoon nap, without significant impact on basic cognitive functions.NCT04044885.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Korean-language version of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) among Korean nurses.
METHODS: We analyzed secondary data from 801 direct care nurses working at a tertiary, private, nonprofit, teaching hospital in South Korea. Descriptive statistics, internal consistency coefficients, and intercorrelations were calculated. The latent factor structure of the HSOPSC was examined using exploratory structural equation modeling techniques, which account for the noncontinuous nature of ordinal data.
RESULTS: Although a majority of subscales showed acceptable to good internal consistency, 4 dimensions (staffing, overall perceptions of patient safety, organizational learning-continuous improvement, and nonpunitive response to errors) had reliability levels less than 0.6. The HSOPSC items loaded somewhat diffusely on 3 subscales: staffing, teamwork across units, and organizational learning-continuous improvement. Correlations between the 12 HSOPSC factors indicated discriminant validity. Convergent validity was supported by correlations between the 12 subscales and a single-item outcome variable, namely, patient safety grade. Several items did not load well on their respective subscales, but most items fit the underlying theoretical model implied by the HSOPSC, resulting in an acceptable model fit (confirmatory fit index = 0.985, root mean square error of approximation = 0.034, weighted root mean square residual = 0.54).

This article outlines some principles and applications of this therapeutic approach as adapted to the treatment of insomnia. Based on Beck's model, this psychotherapeutic approach seeks to modify sleep-related dysfunctional beliefs and thoughts and maladaptive cognitive processes involved in the exacerbation and perpetuation of insomnia. This is accomplished through the use of several cognitive restructuring procedures. After outlining a conceptual model of insomnia, which emphasizes the mediating role of dysfunctional cognitions in the development and maintenance of chronic insomnia, the rationale and general principles of cognitive therapy for insomnia are presented, followed by a description of the treatment procedures, clinical case illustrations, and practical implementation issues. Future directions include the need to refine cognitive interventions and to examine the unique contribution of this therapeutic component to the overall efficacy of multifaceted cognitive-behavioral therapy.},

	abstract = {Insomnia disorder affects a large proportion of the population on a situational, recurrent or chronic basis and is among the most common complaints in medical practice. The disorder is predominantly characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep duration or quality and difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, along with substantial distress and impairments of daytime functioning. It can present as the chief complaint or, more often, co‑occurs with other medical or psychiatric disorders, such as pain and depression. Persistent insomnia has been linked with adverse long-term health outcomes, including diminished quality of life and physical and psychological morbidity. Despite its high prevalence and burden, the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood. In the past decade, important changes in classification and diagnostic paradigms have instigated a move from a purely symptom-based conceptualization to the recognition of insomnia as a disorder in its own right. These changes have been paralleled by key advances in therapy, with generic pharmacological and psychological interventions being increasingly replaced by approaches that have sleep-specific and insomnia-specific therapeutic targets. Psychological and pharmacological therapies effectively reduce the time it takes to fall asleep and the time spent awake after sleep onset, and produce a modest increase in total sleep time; these are outcomes that correlate with improvements in daytime functioning. Despite this progress, several challenges remain, including the need to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie insomnia and to develop more cost-effective, efficient and accessible therapies.},

Although much progress has been made toward understanding how these disorders relate to each other, the exact neurobiological mechanisms that link them remain elusive. Sleep changes in depression may be associated with abnormal neurotransmission, genetic polymorphisms, HPA overactivity, impaired plasticity, or most likely a combination of factors. It is therefore crucial that sleep assessments go beyond traditional polysomnography to include a more expanded set of objective measures in the hope that these will uncover the common neurobiology that is thought to underlie insomnia and depression.},

	abstract = {Since ancient times it is known that melancholia and sleep disturbances co-occur. The introduction of polysomnography into psychiatric research confirmed a disturbance of sleep continuity in patients with depression, revealing not only a decrease in Slow Wave Sleep, but also a disinhibition of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, demonstrated as a shortening of REM latency, an increase of REM density, as well as total REM sleep time. Initial hopes that these abnormalities of REM sleep may serve as differential-diagnostic markers for subtypes of depression were not fulfilled. Almost all antidepressant agents suppress REM sleep and a time-and-dose–response relationship between total REM sleep suppression and therapeutic response to treatment seemed apparent. The so-called Cholinergic REM Induction Test revealed that REM sleep abnormalities can be mimicked by administration of cholinomimetic agents. Another important research avenue is the study of chrono-medical timing of sleep deprivation and light exposure for their positive effects on mood in depression. Present day research takes the view on insomnia, i.e., prolonged sleep latency, problems to maintain sleep, and early morning awakening, as a transdiagnostic symptom for many mental disorders, being most closely related to depression. Studying insomnia from different angles as a transdiagnostic phenotype has opened many new perspectives for research into mechanisms but also for clinical practice. Thus, the question is: can the early and adequate treatment of insomnia prevent depression? This article will link current understanding about sleep regulatory mechanisms with knowledge about changes in physiology due to depression. The review aims to draw the attention to current and future strategies in research and clinical practice to the benefits of sleep and depression therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Background
In many patients with depression, symptoms of insomnia herald the onset of the disorder and may persist into remission or recovery, even after adequate treatment. Several studies have raised the question whether insomniac symptoms may constitute an independent clinical predictor of depression. This meta-analysis is aimed at evaluating quantitatively if insomnia constitutes a predictor of depression.
Methods
PubMed, Medline, PsycInfo, and PsycArticles databases were searched from 1980 until 2010 to identify longitudinal epidemiological studies simultaneously investigating insomniac complaints and depressed psychopathology. Effects were summarized using the logarithms of the odds ratios for insomnia at baseline to predict depression at follow-up. Studies were pooled with both fixed- and random-effects meta-analytic models in order to evaluate the concordance. Heterogeneity test and sensitivity analysis were computed.
Results
Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. Considering all studies together, heterogeneity was found. The random-effects model showed an overall odds ratio for insomnia to predict depression of 2.60 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.98–3.42). When the analysis was adjusted for outliers, the studies were not longer heterogeneous. The fixed-effects model showed an overall odds ratio of 2.10 (CI: 1.86–2.38).
Limitations
The main limit is that included studies did not always consider the role of other intervening variables.
Conclusions
Non-depressed people with insomnia have a twofold risk to develop depression, compared to people with no sleep difficulties. Thus, early treatment programs for insomnia might reduce the risk for developing depression in the general population and be considered a helpful general preventive strategy in the area of mental health care.},

Patients with insomnia (n = 70) received 4 weeks' usual care with an FDA-approved hypnotic agent; patients with depression (n = 651) received 8 weeks' active or experimental therapy.Results:Concurrent criterion validity (correlation with measures of a similar construct) was demonstrated by strong (inverse) correlations between the SQS and MQI (week 1 Pearson correlation −.76) and PSQI (week 8 Goodman-Kruskal correlation −.92) sleep quality items in populations with insomnia and depression, respectively. In patients with depression, stronger correlations between the SQS and PSQI core sleep quality components versus other items supported convergent/divergent construct validity (similarity/dissimilarity to related/unrelated measures). Known-groups validity was evidenced by decreasing mean SQS scores across those who sleep normally, those borderline to having sleep problems, and those with problems sleeping. Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) was .62 during a 4-week period of sleep stability in patients with insomnia and .74 in stable patients with depression (1 week). Effect sizes (standardized response means) for change from baseline were 1.32 (week 1) and .67 (week 8) in populations with insomnia and depression, respectively. Mean SQS changes from baseline to week 8 convergently decreased across groups of patients with depression categorized by level of PSQI sleep quality improvement.Conclusions:The SQS possesses favorable measurement characteristics relative to lengthier or more frequently administered sleep questionnaires in patients with insomnia and depression.Clinical Trial Registration:Registry: ClincalTrials.gov, Title: Treatment of Patients With Major Depressive Disorder With MK0869, Identifier: NCT00034983, URL:  https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00034983Citation:Snyder E, Cai B, DeMuro C, Morrison MF, Ball W.

Several studies have shown that in healthy individuals sleep promotes memory consolidation. Notwithstanding this, the consequences of sleep disorders on offline memory consolidation remain poorly investigated. Research studies indicate that patients with insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and narcolepsy often exhibit sleep-related impairment in the consolidation of declarative and procedural information. On the other hand, patients with parasomnias, such as sleep-walking, night terrors and rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder, do not present any memory impairment. These studies suggest that only sleep disorders characterized by increased post-learning arousal and disrupted sleep architecture seem to be associated with offline memory consolidation issues. Such impairments, arising already in childhood, may potentially affect the development and maintenance of an individual's cognitive abilities, reducing their quality of life and increasing the risk of accidents. However, promising findings suggest that successfully treating sleep symptoms can result in the restoration of memory functions and marked reduction of direct and indirect societal costs of sleep disorders.},

	abstract = {Over more than a century of research has established the fact that sleep benefits the retention of memory. In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of “sleep and memory” research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems.},

We examined the effects of CBT-I on sleep-related cognitions, associations between changes in sleep-related cognitions and changes in sleep and symptoms after CBT-I, and the extent to which cognitions mediated the effects of CBT-I. Participants: Stable New York Heart Association Class II-III HF patients (total n = 51; n = 26 or 51.0\% women; M age = 59.1 ± 15.1 years). Methods: HF patients were randomized in groups to group CBT-I (n = 30) or attention control (HF self-management education, n = 21) and completed actigraphy, the Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS) and Sleep Disturbance Questionnaires (SDQ), and self-reported fatigue, depression, anxiety, and sleepiness (baseline, immediately after treatment, six months). We used mixed-effects modeling, mediation analysis with a bootstrapping approach, and Pearson correlations. Results: There was a statistically significant group × mult time effect on DBAS. DBAS mediated the effects of CBT-I on insomnia severity and partially mediated CBT-I effects on fatigue. Improvements in dysfunctional cognitions were associated with improved sleep quality, insomnia severity, sleep latency and decreased fatigue, depression, and anxiety, with sustained effects at six months. Conclusions: Improvement in dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions is an important mechanism for CBT-I effects among HF patients who are especially vulnerable to poor sleep and high symptom burden.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives:Depression has been identified as the most common condition comorbid to insomnia, with findings pointing to the possibility that these disorders may be causally related to each other or may share common mechanisms. Some have suggested that comorbid insomnia and depression may have a different clinical course than either condition alone, and may thus require specific treatment procedures. In this report we examined the clinical characteristics of individuals referred to an academic sleep center who report comorbid symptoms of insomnia and depression and those with symptoms of insomnia outside the context of meaningful depression, and we identified differences between these groups with regard to several cognitive-related variables.Methods:Logistic regression analyses examined whether past week worry, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and insomnia symptom-focused rumination predicted group membership.Results:Individuals with comorbid symptoms of insomnia and depression reported more past-week worry, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and insomnia symptom-focused rumination, than those with symptoms of insomnia without significant depression symptoms. When including all three cognitive-related variables in our model, those with comorbid symptoms reported more severe insomnia symptom-focused rumination, even when controlling for insomnia and mental health severity, among other relevant covariates.Conclusion:The findings contribute to our understanding of the complex nature of comorbid symptoms of insomnia and depression and the specific symptom burden experienced by those with significant depression symptoms in the presence of insomnia. The findings also highlight the need for increased clinical attention to the sleep-focused rumination reported by these patients.Citation:Levenson JC, Benca RM, Rumble ME.

As expected, poor sleepers showed more dysfunctional beliefs than good sleepers on the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep scale–10 item version (DBAS–10). More important, even in good sleepers, DBAS–10 scores positively correlated with the vulnerability to stress-related sleep disturbance as measured by the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test.

Thus, we hypothesized that personality and sleep-related cognitions influence the severity of insomnia, and investigated the association personality and sleep-related cognitions had with various sleep-related parameters, including severity of insomnia. Forty-four patients with psychophysiological insomnia were assessed using The Temperament and Character Inventory, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Dysfunctional Belief and Attitudes toward Sleep Scale, the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Insomnia severity was significantly and positively correlated with harm avoidance, self-transcendence and sleep-related cognitions, and negatively correlated with novelty seeking, reward dependence, and cooperativeness. Dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions were positively correlated with insomnia severity and sleep quality. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that sleep-related cognitions, depression and reward dependence scores were significant determinants of insomnia severity, and that sleep-related cognitions and self-transcendence were significant positive determinants of sleep quality. Reward dependence, depression and sleep-related cognitions were associated with insomnia severity, and comparison with previous findings implied that ‘internalizing behavior’ and depression may be more plausible candidates for the link between personality and insomnia than anxiety. Considering the major role of cognitive–behavioral treatment (CBT) in the treatment of insomnia, assessment of these factors and management of sleep-related cognitions may help alleviate symptoms in patients with insomnia.},

A total of 1,288 college students from four universities in Wuhu city participated in the study. LCA was used to identify the classes of sleep behaviors. Differences in class membership related to selected research factors were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis.Four distinct classes of behaviors were identified: (1) good sleep (Class 1, 31.8\%), (2) prolonged sleep latency (Class 2, 49.1\%), (3) sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction (Class 3, 6.8\%), (4) multiple poor sleep behavior (Class 4, 12.3\%). The latent classes of sleep behavior were correlated with the DBAS-16 total score (rs = −0.109, P {\textless} 0.001). Learning pressure and mental state during the day could affect overall sleep (Class 2, Class 3 and Class 4), and female students were at higher risk of severe sleep problems (Class 3 and Class 4), while bedtime exercised could improve mild sleep problems (Class 2). The sleep behavior of college students in Wuhu city has obvious class heterogeneity, and different influencingfactors may affect sleep to varying degrees. In addition, our research provides a basis for targeted intervnetion in college student’s sleep. .},

	abstract = {Night-time sleep related cognitions have been shown to play a perpetuating role in insomnia. According to the cognitive model of insomnia day time cognitions (i.e. worry, rumination, etc.) may also contribute to it. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of daytime sleep-related rumination in Insomnia Disorder (n= 55, mean age 49.7±16.7 years), Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) (n=33, mean age 58.1±10.2 years) and healthy subjects (n=33, mean age 49.8±13.9), using a set of sleep related variables which included the Daytime Insomnia Symptom Response Scale (DISRS), the Dysfunctional Beliefs about Sleep Scale (DBAS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Daytime sleep related rumination was higher in insomnia when compared to both OSAS (p{\textless}.001) and good sleepers (p{\textless}.001). In insomnia, elevated sleep related daytime rumination was best determined by unhelpful sleep related beliefs (coeff=0.3 p=.004), while in OSAS by insomnia symptoms (coeff=0.9, p=.02). These findings suggest that the association between insomnia-specific daytimerumination and unhelpful beliefs may be considered a cognitive feature of insomnia. In insomnia, sleep related cognition may dominate the 24-hour period. This finding might be of use for further investigations studying therapeutic strategies acting on cognitive processes to prevent and treat insomnia disorder and its comorbid conditions.},

To understand differences in treatment response, there is a dire need to examine processes of change. The purpose was to investigate the long-term association between insomnia-related worry and outcomes following cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia. Methods: Sixty patients with early insomnia (3–12 months duration) received group cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. At pretreatment and at a 1-year follow-up, the patients completed questionnaires indexing two domains of insomnia-related worry (sleeplessness and health), insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression as well as sleep diaries. Results: Decreases in the two worry domains were associated with improvements in all of the outcomes, except for sleep onset latency (SOL), at a medium to large level. Reductions in insomnia-related worry were associated with improvements in insomnia severity, wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and depression, but not in SOL or anxiety. While reductions in worry for sleeplessness were related to improvements in insomnia severity and TST, decreases in worry for health were associated with enhancements in WASO and depression. Conclusion: The findings suggest that reductions in insomnia-related worry might be one process route in which cognitive behavioral therapy operates to improve insomnia symptomatology. The results are discussed in relation to theory, clinical implications, and future research.},

Baseline and outcome data from four randomised controlled trials (n = 276) were used. Predictors were the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep-10 (DBAS-10), Sleep-Related Behaviours Questionnaire (SRBQ), and Sleep Problems Acceptance Questionnaire (SPAQ), and empirically derived factors from a factor analysis combining all items at baseline (n = 835). Baseline values were used to predict post-treatment outcome, and pre–post changes in the predictors were used to predict follow-up outcomes after 3–6 months, 1 year, or 3–10 years, measured both as insomnia severity and as better or worse long-term sleep patterns. A majority (29 of 52) of predictions of insomnia severity were significant, but when controlling for insomnia severity, only two (DBAS-10 at short-term and SRBQ at mid-term follow-up) of the 12 predictions using established scales, and three of the 40 predictions using empirically derived factors, remained significant. The strongest predictor of a long-term, stable sleep pattern was insomnia severity reduction during treatment. Using all available predictors in an overfitted model, 21.2\% of short- and 58.9\% of long-term outcomes could be predicted. We conclude that although the explored constructs may have important roles in CBT-I, the present study does not support that the DBAS-10, SRBQ, SPAQ, or factors derived from them, would be unique predictors of outcome.},

We here used network analysis in a large sample (N = 2089) to obtain an integrated view on the associations of personality traits with both overall insomnia severity and different insomnia characteristics, while distinguishing direct from indirect associations. We first estimated a network describing the associations among the five factor model personality traits and overall insomnia severity. Overall insomnia severity was associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and openness. Subsequently, we estimated a separate network describing the associations among the personality traits and each of the seven individual items of the Insomnia Severity Index. This revealed relatively separate clusters of daytime and nocturnal insomnia complaints, that both contributed to dissatisfaction with sleep, and were both most directly associated with neuroticism and conscientiousness. The approach revealed the strongest direct associations between personality traits and the severity of different insomnia characteristics and overall insomnia severity. Differentiating them from indirect associations identified the targets for improving Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia with the highest probability of effectively changing the network of associated complaints.},

Participants were asked to complete the Athens Insomnia Scale and the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep scale both at the baseline and at the end of treatment. The results showed that although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia greatly reduced individuals’ scores on both scales, the decrease in dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep with treatment did not seem to mediate improvement in insomnia.

Method: Participants were 188 adults (117 women; Mage = 47.4 years, SD = 12.6) meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; text rev.; DSM–IV–TR; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000) diagnostic criteria for chronic insomnia (Mduration: 14.5 years, SD: 12.8). Participants were randomized to behavior therapy (BT; n = 63), cognitive therapy (CT; n = 65), or CBT (n = 60). The outcome measure was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Hypothesized BT mediators were sleep-incompatible behaviors, bedtime variability (BTv), risetime variability (RTv) and time in bed (TIB). Hypothesized CT mediators were worry, unhelpful beliefs, and monitoring for sleep-related threat. Results: The behavioral processes mediated outcome for BT but not CT. The cognitive processes mediated outcome in both BT and CT. The subgroup scoring high on both behavioral and cognitive processes had a marginally significant better outcome if they received CBT relative to BT or CT. The subgroup scoring relatively high on behavioral but low on cognitive processes and received BT or CBT did not differ from those who received CT. The subgroup scoring relatively high on cognitive but low on behavioral processes and received CT or CBT did not differ from those who received BT. Conclusion: The behavioral mediators were specific to BT relative to CT. The cognitive mediators were significant for both BT and CT outcomes. Patients exhibiting high levels of both behavioral and cognitive processes achieve better outcome if they receive CBT relative to BT or CT alone.

The purpose with the investigation was to examine whether improvements in pre-sleep arousal, unhelpful beliefs about sleep, and maladaptive sleep behaviors mediate the outcomes in in-person CBT-I.
Materials and methods
Thirty participants with chronic insomnia previously involved in a randomized controlled trial testing cognitive behavioral therapy versus a waitlist participated. At pretreatment and post-treatment, participants completed questionnaires and sleep diaries assessing pre-sleep arousal, unhelpful beliefs about sleep, maladaptive sleep behaviors, insomnia severity, dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and subjective sleep parameters. Outcome measures were re-administered at a 3-month follow-up.
Results
The results indicated that decreases in pre-sleep cognitive arousal mediated the effect on dysfunction, and that decreases in pre-sleep somatic arousal had a mediating effect on sleep quality. Reductions in unhelpful beliefs mediated the treatment effect on insomnia severity, dysfunction, and depression. Decreases in bedtime variability mediated the outcome on insomnia severity, and reductions in time in bed had a mediating effect on total wake time and sleep quality. Noteworthy is also that improvements in the outcomes could be attributed to reductions in the mediators (50–70\% of the variance). Neither rise time variability nor napping mediated the improvements.
Conclusion
These findings are clearly supportive of cognitive-behavioral models of insomnia by highlighting pre-sleep arousal, unhelpful beliefs about sleep, and maladaptive sleep behaviors as mediators in the treatment of insomnia. The results are also important for clinical work and for testing new approaches in future research.

	abstract = {Background: Higher levels of insomnia predict greater depression severity among older adults; however, the psychological mechanisms underlying this relationship are unclear. This study tested a path model that explored whether dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and hopelessness mediated the relationship from insomnia to depression. It was hypothesized that insomnia would predict depression, both directly and indirectly, via dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and hopelessness.
Methods: A community sample of 218 independent-living Australian older adults aged from 65 to 96 years completed a self-report questionnaire package. From the initial 218 participants, 171 completed a measure of depression three months later.
Results: Path analysis demonstrated that maladaptive sleep beliefs and hopelessness partly explained how insomnia inﬂuenced depression, irrespective of the presence of obstructive sleep apnea and/or restless legs syndrome.
Conclusions: An older adult’s beliefs about sleep and sense of hopelessness were important psychological factors that helped explain how insomnia related to depression.},

Whilst research has examined the relationships between perfectionism and insomnia, the mediating role of dysfunctional sleep-related cognition (i.e. sleep-related worry and dysfunctional beliefs about the biological attribution of and consequences of poor sleep) has yet to be examined. This study aimed to determine whether aspects of multidimensional perfectionism were related to increased reporting of insomnia symptoms. In addition, the potential mediating role of dysfunctional sleep-related cognition and anxiety symptoms was examined. Members of the general population (N = 624) completed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale. The results showed that perfectionism dimensions, anxiety symptoms, and dysfunctional sleep-related cognition were significantly associated with insomnia symptoms. Regression-based mediation analyses further showed that both dysfunctional sleep-related cognition and anxiety significantly mediated the associations between insomnia symptoms and three perfectionism dimensions (i.e. doubts about action, parental expectations, and parental criticism). The experience of perfectionistic tendencies, anxiety, and dysfunctional sleep-related cognition may initiate behavioural strategies (e.g. daytime napping) when faced with an acute sleep problem. However, these strategies may serve to transition insomnia from an acute to a chronic condition.},

This paper presents new psychometric data on an abbreviated version of the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-16), a 16-item self-report measure designed to evaluate a subset of those sleep related cognitions. Design: Psychometric study of a patient-reported measure of sleep related beliefs based on existing clinical and research databases. Participants: A total of 283 individuals (60\% women; mean age of 46.6 years old) with insomnia, including 124 clinical patients and 159 research participants. Measurements and Results: Participants completed the DBAS, Insomnia Severity Index, Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories, daily sleep diaries for 2 weeks, and 3 nights of polysomnography (research sample only) as part of a baseline assessment. The DBAS-16 was found to be reliable, as evidenced by adequate internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.77 for clinical and 0.79 for research samples) and temporal stability (r = 0.83). The factor structure was similar to the original 30-item version, with 4 factors emerging and reﬂecting: (a) perceived consequences of insomnia, (b) worry/helplessness about insomnia, (c) sleep expectations, and (d) medication. DBAS total scores were signiﬁcantly correlated with other self-report measures of insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression, but not with speciﬁc sleep parameters. Conclusion: The psychometric qualities of this abbreviated DBAS-16 version seem adequate. This patient-reported measure should prove a useful instrument to evaluate the role of sleep related beliefs and attitudes in insomnia and to monitor change on this cognitive variable as a potential moderator of treatment outcome.},

	abstract = {Objective
Trait predisposition to hyperarousal and pre-sleep state hyperarousal are considered key factors in insomnia, but research also supports the role of cognitive and metacognitive processes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between unhelpful sleep-related beliefs, sleep-related metacognition and trait/pre-sleep state arousal in insomnia disorder.
Method
Sixty-eight subjects with insomnia disorder (DSM-5) and 36 good sleepers were evaluated with a set of questionnaires that included Dysfunctional Beliefs about Sleep scale (DBAS), Metacognitions Questionnaire – Insomnia (MCQI), Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS), and Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS). The statistical analyses included univariate, multivariate regression and mediation analyses.
Results
Subjects with insomnia reported higher scores on the DBAS, MCQI, APS, and PSAS (p's{\textless}0.001) compared to good sleepers. In the insomnia group, trait hyper-arousal was best determined by insomnia-related metacognition (p=0.02). Pre-sleep cognitive arousal was determined by insomnia-related metacognition (p=0.001) and trait hyperarousal (p{\textless}0.0001) after controlling for years of insomnia. Insomnia-metacognitive activity mediated the association between trait-hyperarousal and cognitive arousal (p=0.01, p=0.002) and the bidirectional association between pre-sleep cognitive and somatic arousal (p=0.002, p=0.04).
Conclusion
This study suggests that a broad range of cognitive and metacognitive processes may be involved in the development of sleep-related arousal among people with insomnia. Insomnia metacognitive activity may influence trait factors and pre-sleep state factors depending on insomnia duration. Both insomnia evaluation and treatment may also be focused on insomnia metacognitive processes especially in subject with a long history of insomnia.},

However, few studies have examined putative mechanisms of change based on the cognitive model of insomnia. Identification of modifiable mechanisms by which the treatment works may guide efforts to further improve the efficacy of insomnia treatment. The current study therefore has two aims: (1) to replicate the finding that online CBT is effective for insomnia and (2) to test putative mechanism of change (i.e., safety behaviors and dysfunctional beliefs). Accordingly, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in which individuals with insomnia were randomized to either online CBT for insomnia (n = 36) or a waiting-list control group (n = 27). Baseline and posttest assessments included questionnaires assessing insomnia severity, safety behaviors, dysfunctional beliefs, anxiety and depression, and a sleep diary. Three- and six-month assessments were administered to the CBT group only. Results show moderate to large statistically significant effects of the online treatment compared to the waiting list on insomnia severity, sleep measures, sleep safety behaviors, and dysfunctional beliefs. Furthermore, dysfunctional beliefs and safety behaviors mediated the effects of treatment on insomnia severity and sleep efficiency. Together, these findings corroborate the efficacy of online CBT for insomnia, and suggest that these effects were produced by changing maladaptive beliefs, as well as safety behaviors. Treatment protocols for insomnia may specifically be enhanced by more focused attention on the comprehensive fading of sleep safety behaviors, for instance through behavioral experiments.},

Both guided online and individual face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) are effective in improving insomnia symptoms and sleep efficiency. Little is known about the underlying mechanisms generating this effect. The present study tests the assumption that pre-sleep arousal, sleep-related worry and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep are mediators in the effect of cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia.
Methods
A secondary analysis was performed on data previously collected from a randomized controlled trial (N = 90). In this trial, participants were randomized to either a face-to-face CBT-I condition, an internet-delivered CBT-I condition, or a wait-list group. This article reports on the efficacy of these interventions on pre-sleep arousal, sleep-related worry, and dysfunctional beliefs. Furthermore, we investigated whether these measures mediated the treatment effect on insomnia severity and sleep efficiency.
Results
Both treatment modalities were efficacious for these cognitive measures; however, face-to-face treatment showed superiority over the online treatment. All three cognitive measures mediated the effect on insomnia severity. Sleep-related worry and pre-sleep arousal mediated the effect on sleep efficiency, but dysfunctional beliefs did not.
Conclusion
Overall, these results point toward the importance of cognitive processes in the treatment of insomnia, implying that psychological treatments for insomnia may best be guided by (also) targeting these cognitive processes.},

The sample consisted of 155 primary insomnia patients with sleep maintenance complaints. Of these, 98 were randomized to CBT, 23 were assigned to progressive muscle relaxation training (PMR), and 34 were assigned to a control (sham therapy or wait-list) condition (CON). All patients completed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), a sleep-related Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) and nightly sleep diaries for 2 weeks prior to receiving their assigned treatment. They then completed sleep diaries throughout an 8-week acute treatment period and during a 2-week period at a posttherapy follow-up. A subset of the sample (n=67) also completed polysomnography immediately before and after completing their assigned treatment. Preliminary regression analyses conducted with a small subset (n=15) of the patients receiving CBT showed those with relatively high levels of unhelpful sleep-related beliefs (Type 1 patients), as reflected by their pretherapy responses to the DBAS and SES questionnaires, showed markedly greater reductions in nocturnal wakefulness in response to CBT than did those (Type 2 patients) reporting less pronounced sleep-related beliefs. Given these findings, we used the regression equation derived from our initial analyses to dichotomize our entire sample into Type 1 (n=82; 52.9\%) and Type 2 (n=73; 47.1\%) subgroups. Subsequent comparisons showed CBT-treated Type 1 patients had significantly less wake time after sleep onset during most of the 8-week treatment phase than did the Type 1 and 2 individuals assigned to either PMR or CON. Relative to patients assigned to the PMR and CON conditions, CBT-treated Type 1 patients showed better performance across multiple subjective and objective benchmarks of clinically significant improvement, whereas the CBT-treated Type 2 patients did not. Results suggest that insomnia patients' pretherapy cognitive dispositions predict CBT outcome, and those with a pronounced sense of sleep-related helplessness are best suited for this treatment which targets this cognitive stance.},

Yet previous studies addressing these factors have been cross-sectional in nature and could not be used to infer the time sequences of the association. The current study used a six-year follow-up to examine the predisposing roles of these two factors and their interactions with major life stressors in the development of insomnia.Methods:One hundred seventeen college students recruited for a survey in 2006 participated in this follow-up survey in 2012. In 2006, they completed a packet of questionnaires including the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Questionnaire, 10-item version (DBAS-10), the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); in 2012 they completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the modified Life Experiences Survey (LES).Results:Fourteen of the participants were found to suffer from insomnia as measured by the ISI. Logistic regression showed that scores on both DBAS-10 and FIRST could predict insomnia at follow-up. When the interaction of DBAS-10 and LES and that of FIRST and LES were added, both DBAS-10 and FIRST remained significant predictors, while the interaction of FIRST and LES showed a near-significant trend in predicting insomnia.Conclusions:The results showed that both vulnerability to stress-related sleep disturbances and maladaptive sleep beliefs are predisposing factors for insomnia. The hypothesized interaction effect between sleep vulnerability and major life stressors was found to be marginal. The maladaptive sleep beliefs, on the other hand, showed a predisposing effect independent from the influences of negative life events.Citation:Yang CM, Hung CY, Lee HC.

Method: Three hundred and three participants (Mage ¼ 43.3 years; SD ¼ 11.6) were randomly assigned to SHUTi or an online patient education condition and assessed at baseline, postintervention (nine weeks after baseline), and six and 12 months after the intervention period. Cognitive variables were selfreported internal and chance sleep locus of control, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep (DBAS), sleep speciﬁc self-efﬁcacy, and insomnia knowledge. Primary outcomes were self-reported online ratings of insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index), and sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset from online sleep diaries, collected 12 months after the intervention period.
Results: Those who received SHUTi had, at postassessment, higher levels of insomnia knowledge (95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] ¼ 0.10e0.16) and internal sleep locus of control (95\% CI ¼ 0.04e0.55) as well as lower DBAS (95\% CI ¼ 1.52e2.39) and sleep locus of control attributed to chance (95\% CI ¼ 0.15e0.71). Insomnia knowledge, chance sleep locus of control, and DBAS mediated the relationship between condition and at least one 12-month postassessment sleep outcome. Within the SHUTi condition, changes in each cognitive variable (with the exception of internal sleep locus of control) predicted improvement in at least one sleep outcome one year later.

There has been little systematic investigation of how sleep-related cognitions are being assessed in CBT-I trials and no meta-analysis of the impact of CBT-I on dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, a core cognitive component of treatment. Academic Search Complete, Medline, CINAHL and PsychInfo from 1990 to 2018 were searched to identify randomized controlled trials of CBT-I in adults (!18 years) reporting some measure of sleep-related cognitions. Sixteen randomized controlled trials were identiﬁed comparing 1134 CBT-I and 830 control subjects. The Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale was utilized almost exclusively to assess sleep-related cognitions in these trials. Hedge's g at 95\% conﬁdence interval (CI) was calculated to assess CBT-I effect size at post-treatment compared to controls. CBT-I signiﬁcantly reduced dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (g ¼ À0.90, 95\% CI -1.19, À0.62) at post-treatment. Three trials contributed data to estimate effect size for long-term effects (g ¼ À1.04, 95\% CI -2.07, À0.02) with follow up time ranging from 3 to 18 mo. We concluded that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia has moderate to large effects on dysfunctional beliefs about sleep.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES:

Many studies have reported a positive association between sleep problems and suicidal ideation. Some prospective studies in the elderly have shown that insomnia is a risk factor for suicide death after controlling for other depressive symptoms. However, hypotheses to explain how this risk is mediated have not previously been assessed. We tested the hypothesis that insomnia symptoms are related to suicidal ideation through mediation by dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep and/or nightmares.

METHODS:

We measured symptoms of depression, hopelessness, insomnia severity, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep, nightmares, and suicidal ideation intensity on a convenience sample of 50 patients with depressive disorders, including 23 outpatients, 16 inpatients, and 11 suicidal ED patients. Mediation analysis was used to assess the indirect effects of insomnia symptoms on suicidal ideation through dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and through nightmares.

RESULTS:

Our findings again confirmed a positive association between insomnia symptoms and the intensity of suicidal ideas in depressed patients (b = 0.64, 95\% CI = [0.14, 1.15]). However, we extended and clarified our earlier findings by now showing that dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep as well as nightmares may mediate the association between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation. The indirect effects of insomnia symptoms through dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and through nightmares were 0.38 (-0.03, 0.97) and 0.35 (0.05, 0.75), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS:

Nightmares as well as dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep each are positively and independently related to the intensity of suicidal ideation, and the effect of insomnia symptoms appears to be mediated through these two variables.

	abstract = {Introduction
In behavioural medicine the concept of acceptance, that is willingness to accept things that can not be altered, has gained popularity and scientific support. How acceptance influences the experience of poor sleep in insomnia has not yet been investigated. To study acceptance in insomnia, we developed a questionnaire with 10 items, the Insomnia Acceptance Questionnaire (IAQ), following the model of the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, CPAQ. The IAQ consists of two subscales, labelled Activity Engagement (AE) and Willingness (W).
Materials and methods
Acceptance data was collected in a randomised controlled insomnia treatment study in primary care (n=66). Correlations with other sleep related measures at baseline and follow-up assessments were analysed: the Insomnia severity index (ISI), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), sleep quality (SQ), the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), the Fatigue severity scale (FSS), the Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and the Short-form health survey (SF-36).
Results
Acceptance correlated negatively with subjective insomnia severity at baseline, measured with ISI, with less acceptance associated with more insomnia. On the other hand, more objective measures derived from sleep diaries (SOL, WASO, TST) did not correlate with acceptance. There were negative correlations with fatigue and anxiety, but positive correlations with perceived sleep quality and mental health. Daytime sleepiness did not correlate with acceptance. Increased acceptance during treatment correlated with lower ISI-score, less anxiety and better mental health, but not with changes in objective sleep time assessed with SOL, WASO, or TST.
Conclusion
Low acceptance characterized by a lack of willingness to accept insomnia symptoms, seemed to be more closely correlated with the subjective experience of insomnia than with sleep diary parameters at baseline. During the course of treatment, increased acceptance correlated with decreased perceived insomnia and reduced anxiety, and was associated with better mental health. Thus, enhanced acceptance of symptoms could be an important target in insomnia treatment.

	abstract = {Insomnia and depression is a common and debilitating comorbidity, and treatment is usually given mainly for depression. Guided Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (ICBT-i) was, in a recent study on which this report is based, found superior to a treatment for depression (ICBT-d) for this patient group, but many patients did not reach remission.
Aims
To identify facilitating and hindering factors for patients in ICBT-i and ICBT-d and formulate hypotheses for future research.
Method
Qualitative telephone interviews at the time of the 6-month follow-up. Thirty-five interviews were done and analyzed with a grounded theory approach. Based on the qualitative results, an iterative method-triangulation including quantitative and semi-qualitative was performed.
Results
The interviews were coded into 738 sentences, condensed into 47 categories and finally 11 themes. Four areas were investigated further with method triangulation: Opinions about treatment, adherence, hindering symptoms and acceptance. Patients in ICBT-i were more positive regarding the treatment than patients in ICBT-d. Using treatment components was positively associated with outcome in both groups. Symptoms of insomnia, depression and other comorbidities were perceived as more hindering for ICBT-d than for ICBT-i. Acceptance of diagnose-related problems as well as negative emotions and cognitions was positively associated with outcome for ICBT-i.
Proposed future research hypotheses
1) A combination of CBT for insomnia and CBT for depression is more effective than only one of the treatments. 2) Additional therapist support increases outcomes for patients with more comorbidities. 3) Acceptance is a mechanism of change in CBT-i.},

The goal of this paper is to present a conceptual framework for the cognitive mechanisms of insomnia based upon mindfulness and acceptance approaches. The existing cognitive and behavioral models of insomnia are first reviewed and a two-level model of cognitive (primary) and metacognitive (secondary) arousal is presented in the context of insomnia. We then focus on the role of metacognition in mindfulness and acceptance-based therapies, followed by a review of these therapies in the treatment of insomnia. A conceptual framework is presented detailing the mechanisms of metacognition in the context of insomnia treatments. This model proposes that increasing awareness of the mental and physical states that are present when experiencing insomnia symptoms and then learning how to shift mental processes can promote an adaptive stance to one’s response to these symptoms. These metacognitive processes are characterized by balanced appraisals, cognitive flexibility, equanimity, and commitment to values and are posited to reduce sleep-related arousal, leading to remission from insomnia. We hope that this model will further the understanding and impact of mindfulness and acceptance-based approaches to insomnia.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of ACT on depression reduction and further examine the relationship between different follow-up periods, different degree of depression, and different age of patients through subgroup analysis.
Methods
Relevant electronic databases were searched from Jan 2010 to Aug 2018, including CNKI, WANFANG, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO. Two reviewers independently screened for eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of the included studies. The Cochrane Collaboration's bias assessment tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias for included studies, and Review Manager 5.3 Software for the meta-analysis
Results
18 studies with 1,088 participants were included in the review. Four studies were rated as high-quality studies, and the remaining 14 studies were rated as moderate quality studies. ACT significantly reduced depression as compared with the control group [SMD = 0.59, 95\% CI (0.38, 0.81)]. The subgroup analysis found a significant difference between ACT and control group after post-intervention, three months follow up, mild depression group and adults group, [SMD= 0.62, 95\% CI (0.35, 0.90), [SMD= 0.55, 95\% CI (0.23, 0.87)], [SMD= 0.65, 95\% CI (0.40, 0.91)], [SMD= 0.52, 95\% CI (0.33, 0.71)] respectively.
Limitations
The heterogeneity between included studies results in heterogeneity of the results. Most of the specific methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment were not clear. The search results had limitations since only the published studies in Chinese and English were searched and lacked a search for gray and paper documents.
Conclusions
The current study suggested that ACT was significantly for reducing depressive symptoms compared with the control group, especially at three months of follow-up, adult group and mild depression. More research is needed to investigate the difference effects for minor group, moderate and severe depression and long-term follow-up.},

Previous research has established bivariate relationships between anxiety symptoms, emotion regulation, and insomnia symptom severity; however, limited research has examined how the interaction between emotion regulation and anxiety symptoms may be associated with insomnia symptom severity. A sample of 468 undergraduate participants and a subsample of 136 participants meeting a self-reported cutoff score for insomnia, completed questionnaires assessing anxiety, insomnia symptom severity, and emotion regulation difficulties. Among the general sample of all participants, the interaction between anxiety symptoms and both overall emotion regulation difficulties and limited access to emotion regulation strategies were associated with insomnia symptom severity. However, among the insomnia subsample, emotion regulation moderated this relationship, such that insomnia symptom severity increased as anxiety symptoms increased among those with high emotion regulation difficulties, but were unaffected by changes in anxiety symptoms among those with low emotion regulation difficulties. These findings suggest that maladaptive emotion regulation may be necessary for anxiety symptoms to have a negative influence on sleep difficulties, meaning that during treatment, it may be important to address both an individual's anxiety symptoms and emotion regulation difficulties, particularly among those with clinical levels of insomnia.},

	abstract = {Background There has been growing support for digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (dCBT-I) as a scalable intervention that both reduces insomnia and prevents depression. However, the mechanisms by which dCBT-I reduces and prevents depression is less clear. Methods This was a randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms: dCBT-I (N=358), or online sleep education as the control condition (N=300). Outcome variables were measured at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and one-year follow-up, and included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16), and the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ). The analyses tested change in PTQ scores as a mediator for post-treatment insomnia, post-treatment depression, and incident depression at one-year follow-up. Results Reductions in rumination (PTQ) were significantly larger in the dCBT-I condition compared to control. Results also showed that reductions in rumination significantly mediated the improvement in post-treatment insomnia severity (proportional effect = 11\%) and post-treatment depression severity (proportional effect = 19\%) associated with the dCBT-I condition. Finally, reductions in rumination also significantly mediated the prevention of clinically significant depression via dCBT-I (proportional effect = 42\%). Limitations Depression was measured with a validated self-report instrument instead of clinical interviews. Durability of results beyond one-year follow-up should also be tested in future research.

	abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between bedtime counterfactual thoughts, depressive symptoms, nocturnal counterproductive thought-control strategies and insomnia disorder. Six hundred and fifty adults from the general population were recruited and provided data on their counterfactual thoughts' frequency at bedtime, depressive symptoms and use of nocturnal maladaptive strategies of thought control. In addition, all participants followed a face-to-face clinical interview for the diagnosis of insomnia disorder. A model positing moderated mediation was tested using conditional process modelling. Overall, 19\% of participants met diagnostic criteria for a chronic insomnia diagnosis. Bootstrapped mediation analyses indicated that the association of bedtime counterfactual processing and insomnia diagnosis is mediated by depressive symptoms (B = 0.035, SE = 0.007, bootstrapped 95\% CI = 0.023, 0.051). Furthermore, the effects of such a mediation model were significantly larger among individuals with high levels of aggressive suppression than those with low levels of aggressive suppression (B = 0.002, SE = 0.001, bootstrapped 95\% CI = 0.001, 0.004). A second model in which a worry strategy moderates the relationship between bedtime counterfactual processing and depressive symptoms was not statistically significant (B = 0.0036, SE = 0.013, p = .78). The present study adds to the literature on the importance of self-attacking thoughts and negative affects at bedtime. We recommend the evaluation of the impact of adding self-attacks management strategies to cognitive behavior therapy for individuals with an insomnia disorder.},

	abstract = {Background Insomnia is frequently co-morbid with depression, with a bidirectional relationship between these disorders. There is evidence that insomnia-specific interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, may lead to improvements in depression. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine whether treatment of insomnia leads to improved depression outcomes in individuals with both insomnia and depression. Methods We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effect of treatment for insomnia disorder on depression in patients with both disorders. Results Three thousand eight hundred and fifteen studies were reviewed, and 23 studies met inclusion criteria. Although all of the studies suggested a positive clinical effect of insomnia treatment on depression outcomes, most of the results were not statistically significant. Although the interventions and populations were highly variable, the meta-analysis indicates moderate to large effect size (ES) improvement in depression as measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (ES = −1.29, 95\%CI [−2.11, −0.47]) and Beck Depression Inventory (ES = −0.68, 95\%CI [−1.29, −0.06]). Conclusions These results support that treating insomnia in patients with depression has a positive effect on mood. Future trials are needed to identify the subtypes of patients whose depression improves during treatment with insomnia-specific interventions, and to identify the mechanisms by which treating insomnia improves mood.},

	abstract = {Background
Co-occurring insomnia and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress pose difficult diagnostic and treatment decisions for clinicians. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) is the recommended first-line insomnia treatment, however symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress may reduce the effectiveness of CBTi. We examined the effect of low, moderate, and severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress on insomnia improvements during CBTi.
Methods
We undertook a chart-review of 455 patients (67\% Female, Age M = 51.7, SD = 15.6) attending an outpatient CBTi program. Sleep diaries and questionnaire measures of insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were completed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and three-month follow up. We examined 1) the effect of low, moderate, and severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress before treatment on changes in sleep diary and questionnaire measures of insomnia during CBTi, and 2) changes in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during CBTi.
Results
Sleep diary and questionnaire measures of insomnia severity showed moderate-to-large improvements during CBTi (d = 0.5–2.7, all p ≤ 0.001), and were not moderated by levels of depression, anxiety or stress before treatment (all interactions p {\textgreater} 0.05). Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress improved by three-month follow-up (M improvement = 41–43\%; CI = 28–54, Cohen's d = 0.4–0.7).
Conclusions
Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress do not impair the effectiveness of CBTi. Instead, CBTi was associated with moderate-to-large improvement of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in patients with insomnia disorder. Clinicians should refer patients with insomnia for CBTi even in the presence of comorbid symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.},

	abstract = {There is robust evidence of an association between insomnia, anxiety, and depression in adolescence. The aim of this review is to describe and synthesize potential mechanisms underlying this association and explore implications for the design of adolescent behavioral sleep interventions. Specifically, we examine whether insomnia symptoms are a mechanism for the development of internalizing symptoms in adolescence and whether sleep interventions are an effective treatment for both insomnia and internalizing symptoms in adolescence because they target the shared mechanisms underlying these disorders. Research using different methodologies points to the role of sequential, parallel, and interacting mechanisms. In this paper, we review a wide range of relevant biological (i.e., polymorphisms and dysregulation in serotonin, dopamine, and circadian clock genes; alterations in corticolimbic and mesolimbic brain circuits; cortisol reactivity to stress; inflammatory cytokine dysregulation; biased memory consolidation; changes in sleep architecture), psychological (i.e., cognitive inflexibility, interpretational biases, judgment biases, negative attribution styles, worry, rumination, biased attention to threat, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep, misperception of sleep deficit), and social mechanisms (i.e., reduced and impaired social interactions, unhelpful parenting behaviors, family stress) and propose an integrative multilevel model of how these phenomena may interact to increase vulnerability to both insomnia and internalizing disorders. Several ‘biopsychosocial’ mechanisms hold promise as viable treatment targets for adolescent behavioral sleep interventions, which may reduce both insomnia and internalizing symptoms.},

	abstract = {Aim: According to the Cognitive Model of Insomnia, engaging in sleep-related cognitive processes may lead to sleep problems over time. The aim was to examine associations between five sleep-related cognitive processes and the incidence of insomnia, and to investigate if baseline anxiety and depression influence the associations. Methods: 2333 participants completed surveys on nighttime and daytime symptoms, depression, anxiety, and cognitive processes at baseline and six months after the first assessment. Only those without insomnia at baseline were studied. Participants were categorized as having or not having incident insomnia at the next time point. Baseline anxiety and depression were tested as moderators. Results: Three cognitive processes predicted incident insomnia later on. Specifically, more safety behaviors and somatic arousal at Time 1 increased the risk of developing insomnia. When investigating changes in the cognitive processes over time, reporting an increase of worry and safety behaviors also predicted incident insomnia. Depressive symptoms moderated the association between changes in worry and incident insomnia. Conclusion: These findings provide partial support for the hypothesis that cognitive processes are associated with incident insomnia. In particular, safety behaviors, somatic arousal and worry increase the risk for incident insomnia. Preventative interventions and future research are discussed.},
