## North ideas

Main idea: multiple linear regression with cognitive factors as predictors of insomnia severity with depression and anxiety as control variables.

Possible question: Do levels of sleep-related cognition and acceptance predict insomnia severity, when controlling for levels of anxiety and depression?

Association between subjective insomnia severity and self report measures of insomnia acceptance and sleep related beliefs.

Pathway:

-   Why investigate sleep related cognitions and acceptance?

  + DBAS and SPAQ are associated with insomnia symptoms [@bothelius2015]

-   Why control for symptoms of anxiety and depression?

  + They are relevant predictors of insomnia (reference)
  + Related to the two cognitive measures?

## Draft

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a form of intervention based on helping the patient achieve a new form of experiencing thoughts and feelings. ACT comprehends mindfulness, acceptance and cognitive diffusion [@salari2020].

ACT is known as one of the third wave treatments and originates from the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which increases psychological flexibility.

On the whole, ACT is performed with the aim of mental training, increasing motivation, psychological flexibility and self-efficacy in an individual.

As a person with insomnia tries to control his or her thoughts and feelings, his or her insomnia is exacerbated.

Dysfunctional beliefs was a significant mediator of change in insomnia severity post CBT-I intervention [@lancee2019]
