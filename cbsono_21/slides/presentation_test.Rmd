## Introduction

Insomnia sufferers are a group characterized for frequent complaints about quality and quantity of sleep, difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep and early-morning awakenings with inability to return to sleep.

- Psychological disorders like anxiety and depression are known to co-occur with symptoms of insomnia and are possible aggravating factors for sleep problems

- Evidence suggests that the relationship between anxiety and depression with insomnia are bidirectional

- Excess of negatively toned cognitive activity about sleep may maximize worries and ruminative thoughts increasing arousal

- An anxiety state shifts attention to sleep-related threats

## Introduction
### Cognitive-behavioral model of insomnia

- Arousal, cognitions, behaviors, and perceived consequences play an important role in maintaining insomnia symptoms

- People with insomnia tend to hold dysfunctional beliefs and maladaptative behaviors in response to sleep problems

- These beliefs and attitudes about sleep are proxies for the cognitive arousal that feeds the cycle of insomnia

## Hypotesis

People with insomnia tend to be rigid in their thinking and behaviors. Greater levels of psychological flexibility in thoughts and behaviours contributes to decreases in secondary arousal. 

- <b>Hypotesis</b>: Psychological flexibility moderates the relationship  between dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and insomnia severity.

---

## Methods

- **Participants**: 457 participants enrolled for a behavioral treatment for insomnia.

- **Measures**: ISI, DBAS-16, AAQ-II, HADS-A, HADS-D

- **Statistical Analysis**: Multiple linear regression with the form:

$$ 
ISI = Age + Sex + HADSA + HADS-D + DBAS + AAQ-II + DBAS*AAQ-II 
$$
