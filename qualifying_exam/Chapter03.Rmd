## Participants and Study Design

This study's participants were 277 college students (239 females) from the Faculty of Psychology at the Universitat de Barcelona, Spain. The average age of participants was 20.85 Â± 5.71, and the participants received credit for agreeing to participate in this study. The committee of bioethics of the University of Barcelona (Institutional Review Board IRB00003099) approved this study. First, participants were informed about the main objective of the research and signed the informed consent. Then, they responded to a 45-minute online survey (as part of a more extensive study) using the online platform Qualtrics, including the Spanish version of GASP and the HEXACO.
