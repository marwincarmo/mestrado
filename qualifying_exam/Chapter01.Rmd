# Introduction

Insomnia is a disorder related to dissatisfaction with duration or quality of sleep. It can be a source of distress and impairment by decreasing productivity and lowering energy to engage in social activities [@americanpsychiatricassociation2013]. A prolonged exposure is associated with higher risk of adverse outcomes on mental health [@johnson2006; @taylor2005] and cognitive functioning [@fortier-brochu2012]. 

Cognitive arousal is crucial to several behavioral models of insomnia as maintainer of the disorder [@espie2006; @harvey2002; @lundh2005; @morin1993; @ong2012; @perlis1997]. Cognitive and behavioral models of insomnia emphasize the role of sleep related cognitions as maintainers of insomnia. Cognitive-behavioral treatments target modification of habits, routines and ineffective beliefs about sleep, which is shown to be correlated with objective and subjective improvements in sleep [@harvey2014; @montserratsanchez-ortuno2010]. Despite its known effectiveness in insomnia treatment, some patients gain little from the cognitive-behavioral approaches [@dalrymple2010]. An alternative treatment for insomnia is the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which also focuses on cognitions but promotes acceptance of feelings and thoughts related to symptoms rather than its control [@hayes2011acceptance]. 

Be it either approach, non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia are an effective and reliable alternative or complement to the use of medication [@hertenstein2014; @thakral2020]. Because of that, it is also important that valid and reliable assessment tools are available to examine objectively the severity of symptoms and/or the results of an intervention, either in clinical or research settings. Two tools for the assessment of sleep-related cognitions are the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS) and the Sleep Problem Acceptance Questionnaire (SPAQ). Although used widely worldwide, to date no study has assessed its' psychometric properties with a Brazilian sample. Given that those measures were developed in a distinct cultural setting, it's necessary to obtain evidence for the applicability of these instruments within a specific context of a Brazilian-Portuguese speaking population prior to usage in high stakes settings.

## Dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep

A. G. Harvey's model [-@harvey2002] is frequently mentioned as theoretical background in investigations about cognitive process in insomnia. It posits that the excess of negatively toned activity about sleep triggers arousal and distress, channeling attention and monitoring to sleep threats. This may create distorted perceptions of sleep and overestimation of the real deficits during the day. To cope, the individual may engage in safety behaviors that paradoxically increase worry and preclude sleep self correction. In Harvey's model, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep exacerbates negatively toned cognitive activity. Such beliefs are also the backbone of the Microanalytic model [@morin1993insomnia], one of the most popular models for insomnia [@marques2015].

Current evidence favors that beliefs and attitudes about sleep mediates insomnia perpetuation [@akram2020; @chow2018; @harvey2017; @lancee2019], although not all studies have found this association [@norell-clarke2021]. Morin [-@morin1993] suggests that insomnia maintenance feeds from a cyclic process of arousal, dysfunctional cognitions, maladaptive habits and consequences. Arousal refers to excessive activity in emotional, cognitive or physiologic domains, which can create core beliefs that guide information processing [@marques2015]. This may give rise to unrealistic expectations and rigidly held beliefs about requirements for sleep, as well as increased worry about the causes and consequences of sleep disturbances. Subsequent unhealthy sleep practices may include daytime napping, excessive time in bed or indiscriminate use of sleep medication. Consequences, real or perceived, are linked to diminished performance during the day.

### Constructs and Their Relations

Individuals with higher insomnia symptoms typically are stronger endorsers of dysfunctional beliefs about sleep [@carney2006; @cronlein2014; @eidelman2016]. Challenging those beliefs is at the core of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) [@belanger2006]. A recent meta-analysis observed clinically significant improvements in beliefs and attitudes about sleep favoring CBT-I over controls -- although, as the authors warn, those results should be interpreted with care given the low quality of evidence [@edingerjackd.2021]. Insomnia severity was identified as risk factor for anxiety [@neckelmann2007] and depression [@blanken2020; @li2016], but some suggest this relationship the other way around [@chen2017; @jansson-frojmark2008b]. A relationship between anxiety and depression with dysfunctional beliefs about sleep is also expected: Beck's classic cognitive mechanism for the cause and maintenance of depression gives a central role to inaccurate beliefs and maladaptive information processing [@beck1979cognitive]. Anxiety can be elicited from displeasing memories created through exposure to adverse experiences [@brewin1996theoretical]. Thus, unrealistic attributions and expectations about sleep (or lack of sleep) may elicit anxiety-provoking thoughts. Associação entre Depressão e DBAS [@sadler2013].


### Measurement

To assess sleep-disruptive cognitions, Morin et al. [-@morin1993insomnia] developed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale (DBAS). The DBAS started as a 30-item self-report instrument rated in a 100-mm visual analog scale of agreement/disagreement. Later, Morin and colleagues [-@morin2007a] shortened it to a 16-item version, and replaced the response format for a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). The items of the brief version were selected from the original scale based on criteria of response distribution, range, item-total correlations and exploratory oblique factor analysis. A 4-factor structure was fitted to the 16 items in a confirmatory factor analysis, labeled (a) consequences of insomnia, (b) worry about sleep, (c) sleep expectations, (d) medication, and a fifth second-order general factor. The DBAS is broadly employed in experimental studies assessing sleep-related cognitions, especially the 16-item version [@thakral2020]. Moreover, the DBAS-16 outperformed the 30 and 10-item versions in reproducibility of factor structure, measures of internal consistency, concurrent validity and sensitivity to change [@chungka-fai2016]. Many researchers have translated and validated the DBAS-16 across various cultures. These studies successfully replicated the original factor structure and presented good validity evidences [@boysan2010; @dhyani2013; @lang2017].

## Acceptance of sleeping problems

Shifting from the sole focus on the cognitive processes, Third Wave behavior therapies include metacognition as a target for intervention (i.e., changing how one relate to their own thoughts rather than changing its contents) [@hayes2004mindfulness]. Early models of insomnia including the metacognitive content refer to the interpretation of one's own sleep patterns or consequences of poor sleep, as sleep interpreting processes [@lundh2000]. These models also integrate arousal events as key components to the causal chain that leads to insomnia. Lundh [-@lundh2005] presented the idea that insomnia originates from the inability to disengage from information processing. He further argues that cognitive deactivation is essential for sleep occurrence and efforts of metacognitive control prevents the spontaneous processes of relaxation. Ultimately insomnia is maintained by the mutual contribution of sleep interfering process and sleep interpreting process. Acceptance of the natural occurring sleep processes through the adoption of an adaptive stance may help reduce arousal preventing the perpetuation of this cycle [@ong2012].

### Constructs and Their Relations



### Measurement

To date, the Sleep Problem Acceptance Questionnaire (SPAQ) [@bothelius2015] is the only validated measure of acceptance related to sleep difficulties. This instrument is an adaptation of the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire and share its same two-factor structure: *Activity Engagement* and *Willingness*, which were shown to be negatively correlated (*r* = -0.26) [@bothelius2015]. Ultimately, SPAQ's aim is to examine the role of acceptance in relation to quality of sleep. Its items were purposely developed to resemble similar acceptance questionnaires used in other behavioral medicine contexts. Four items compose each factor; they are rated on a 7-point scale, where 0 means "Disagree" and 6 indicates "Completely agree". *Activity Engagement* relates to persistence with normal activities despite perceived dissatisfaction with sleep, whereas *Willingness* captures the ability to give up fighting sleep problems and controlling sleep. SPAQ is gradually gaining popularity as an assessment tool in ACT-based interventions for insomnia in addition or replacement of more general measures of acceptance [@paulos-guarnieri2022].

## The cross-cultural adaptation process

Before using existing measures in a distinct cultural context of where it was originally developed it's important to assess the construct existence and similarity in this new context, since it may manifest itself differently [@flakeConstructValidationSocial2017; @herdmanModelEquivalenceCultural1998]. A model proposed by @herdmanModelEquivalenceCultural1998 devise five types of equivalence to be assessed, namely, (1) Conceptual equivalence; (2) Item equivalence; (3) Semantic equivalence; (4) Operational equivalence; and (5) Measurement equivalence. There are many suggestions for the required steps of a cross-cultural adaptation process [@reichenheim2007]. Nevertheless, the guidelines by @beaton2000 are followed closely by much of the published cross-cultural adaptation research [@arafat2016].

### 1. Items translation

A minimum of two translators, fluent in both source and target language and acquainted with both cultural backgrounds, should produce the initial translation of the instrument [@borsaAdaptacaoValidacaoInstrumentos2012; @epstein2015; @geisinger1994; @reichenheim2007]. They should work independently and it is preferred that one translator is aware of the concepts underlying the questionnaire while the second should have no expertise in its context and be blind or unfamiliar to it [@beaton2000]. The mixed configuration of the translation team justifies because the informed translators are capable of finding appropriate correspondences to highly domain-specific words or expressions while the naive translators are prone to choose terms closer to those used routinely by the target population [@beaton2000].

### 2. Synthesis of the translations

Once the initial translations are completed, a committee should consider the original instrument and the translated versions, and reach an agreement for a single version. Most cross-cultural adaptation guidelines suggest that at least three members form the committee: the two initial translators and a third unbiased judge [@koller2012]. There are also suggestions that this committee can be composed of judges expert on the concepts underlying the questionnaire [@epstein2015; @guillemin1993]. Regardless, judges and authors should work together to assess the equivalence between the original version and the translations regarding semantics, idiomatic equivalence, experiential equivalence, and conceptual equivalence [@borsaAdaptacaoValidacaoInstrumentos2012]. 

### 3. Backtranslation

In the backtranslation phase, the synthesized version should be translated back to the source language in at least two new versions, produced by translators fluent on the source language and with a strong domain of the target language [@gjersing2010; @guillemin1993]. While Beaton et al.'s [-@beaton2000] guideline suggest that the backtranslation should proceed the synthesis of the initial translations, authors such as @borsaAdaptacaoValidacaoInstrumentos2012 argue that this process should be delayed to the last stage of the cross-cultural adaptation process, given that the translation must be thoroughly evaluated before the appreciation by the original authors. There are therefore different views of when this phase must be executed, or even if it is really necessary, given the lack of evidence of its contribution for improving the instrument adaptation [@epstein2015; @geisinger1994; @vanwidenfelt2005]. Either way, the backtranslation process is a way for the original authors to assess the equivalence of meaning between the original and translated items, as well as a way of identifying inconsistencies or conceptual errors [@beaton2000; @borsaAdaptacaoValidacaoInstrumentos2012].

### 4. Expert committee

As hinted in previous sections, there are different views on the formation of the expert committee or when it should be called to action. Authors such as @beaton2000 suggests that the group should be composed of methodologists, health professionals, language professionals, and the translators (forward and back translators) so far involved in the process. They also encourage carefully recording of each decision made by the committee. What underlies this subsequent pahse to the backtranslation is the assessment of aspects not yet considered, such as instrument structure, layout, instructions and adequacy of expressions in the items [@borsaAdaptacaoValidacaoInstrumentos2012]. 

### 5. Pilot study

After all adjustments are completed, the instrument is ready for a pre test with a small sample representative of the target population. To many authors the pilot study is succeeded only by the final semantic adjustments suggested by the pretesting sample [@beaton2000; @dortasjunior2016; @gjersing2010; @reichenheim2007; @wild2005]. The pretesting may unveil unanticipated issues the test subjects might encounter, and any divergences regarding the comprehension of item meaning and expressions as the test instructions [@borsaAdaptacaoValidacaoInstrumentos2012; @epstein2015; @vanwidenfelt2005]. In short, the purpose of the pre-test is to assess whether the examinees can comprehend the concept of the questions in a consist way and as intended by the researchers [@collins2003]. The pretesting can be executed with focus group -- where researchers collect the participants impressions about the writing and content of the instrument --, and/or through individual cognitive interviews, which allow a deeper understanding of the issues raised by the participants [@epstein2015]. Recommendations following the exact sample size for the pilot study also vary. For instance, @beaton2000 suggests probing 30 to 40 subjects. Other authors suggest more modest numbers, like 6 to 10 [@epstein2015] or 5 to 8 subjects [@wild2005]. More relevant than an exact sample size for the pilot study is that participants are a representative sample, in the sense that they should reflect the diversity of cultural backgrounds in the target population [@borsaAdaptacaoValidacaoInstrumentos2012].

# Objectives

The present project therefore aims at (a) developing a Brazilian portuguese translation of the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-16) and the Sleep Problem Acceptance Questionnaire (SPAQ), (b) examining its factorial structure, and (c) examining its construct validity.
