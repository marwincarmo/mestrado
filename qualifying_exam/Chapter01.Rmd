# Introduction

Insomnia disorder is related to dissatisfaction with duration or quality of sleep. It can be a source of distress and impairment by decreasing productivity on work or school and lowering energy to engage in social activities [@americanpsychiatricassociation2013]. Prolonged effects of insomnia are associated with higher risk of harm on mental health [@johnson2006; @taylor2005] and cognitive functioning [@fortier-brochu2012]. Cognitive arousal is crucial to several behavioral models of insomnia as maintainer of the disorder [@espie2006; @harvey2002; @lundh2005; @morin1993; @ong2012; @perlis1997].

## Dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep

Harvey's model [@harvey2002] is frequently mentioned as theoretical background in investigations about cognitive process in insomnia. It posits that the excess of negatively toned activity about sleep triggers arousal and distress, channeling attention and monitoring to sleep threats. This may create distorted perceptions of sleep and overestimation of the real deficits during the day. To cope, the individual may engage in safety behaviors that paradoxically increase worry and preclude sleep self correction. In Harvey's model, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep exacerbates negatively toned cognitive activity. Such beliefs are also the backbone of the Microanalytic model [@morin1993insomnia], one of the most cited models for insomnia in the literature [@marques2015].

Current evidence favors that beliefs and attitudes about sleep mediates insomnia perpetuation [@akram2020; @chow2018; @harvey2017; @lancee2019], although not all studies have found this association [@norell-clarke2021]. Morin [-@morin1993] suggests that insomnia maintenance feeds from a cyclic process of arousal, dysfunctional cognitions, maladaptive habits and consequences. Arousal refers to excessive activity in emotional, cognitive or physiologic domains, which can create core beliefs that guide information processing [@marques2015]. This may give rise to unrealistic expectations and rigidly held beliefs about requirements for sleep, as well as increased worry about the causes and consequences of sleep disturbances. Subsequent unhealthy sleep practices may include daytime napping, excessive time in bed or indiscriminate use of sleep medication. Consequences, real or perceived, are linked to diminished performance during the day.

### Constructs and Their Relations

Individuals that show stronger insomnia symptoms typically demonstrate firm endorsement of dysfunctional beliefs about sleep [@carney2006; @cronlein2014; @eidelman2016]. Challenging those beliefs is in the core of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) [@belanger2006]. A recent meta-analysis observed clinically significant improvements in beliefs and attitudes about sleep favoring CBT-I over controls -- although, as the authors warn, those results should be interpreted with care given the low quality of evidence [@edingerjackd.2021]. Insomnia severity was identified as risk factor for anxiety [@neckelmann2007] and depression [@blanken2020; @li2016], but some studies claim this relationship the other way around [@chen2017; @jansson-frojmark2008b]. A relationship between anxiety and depression with dysfunctional beliefs about sleep is also expected: Beck's classic cognitive mechanism for the cause and maintenance of depression gives a central role to inaccurate beliefs and maladaptive information processing [@beck1979cognitive]. Anxiety can be elicited from displeasing memories created through exposure to adverse experiences [@brewin1996theoretical]. Thus, unrealistic attributions and expectations about sleep (or lack of sleep) may elicit anxiety-provoking thoughts. Associação entre Depressão e DBAS [@sadler2013].


### Measurement

To assess sleep-disruptive cognitions, Morin et al. [-@morin1993insomnia] developed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale (DBAS). The DBAS started as a 30-item self-report instrument rated in a 100-mm visual analog scale of agreement/disagreement. Later, Morin and colleagues [-@morin2007a] shortened it to a 16-item version, and replaced the response format for a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). The items of the brief version were selected from the original scale based on criteria of response distribution, range, item-total correlations and exploratory oblique factor analysis. A 4-factor structure was fitted to the 16 items in a confirmatory factor analysis, labeled (a) consequences of insomnia, (b) worry about sleep, (c) sleep expectations, (d) medication, and a 5th second-order general factor. The DBAS is broadly employed in experimental studies assessing sleep-related cognitions, especially the 16-item version [@thakral2020]. Many researchers translated and validated the DBAS-16 across various cultures. These studies successfully replicated the original factor structure and presented good validity evidences [@boysan2010; @dhyani2013; @lang2017]. Moreover, the DBAS-16 outperformed the 30 and 10-item versions in reproducibility of factor structure, measures of internal consistency, concurrent validity and sensitivity to change [@chungka-fai2016].

### Measurement

## The cross-cultural adaptation process

Before using existing measures in a distinct cultural context of where it was originally developed it's important to assess the construct existence and similarity in this new context, since it may manifest differently [@flakeConstructValidationSocial2017; @herdmanModelEquivalenceCultural1998]. A model proposed by @herdmanModelEquivalenceCultural1998 devise five types of equivalence to be assessed, namely, (1) conceptual equivalence; (2) Item equivalence; (3) Semantic equivalence; (4) Operational equivalence; and (5) Measurement equivalence.

A minimum of two translators, fluent in both source and target language and acquainted with both cultural backgrounds, should produce the initial translation of the instrument [@borsa2012, @epstein2015; @geisinger1994; @reichenheim2007]. They should work independently and it is preferred that one translator is aware of the concepts underlying the questionnaire while the second should be someone with no medical or clinical background and blind to the concepts in the questionnaire [@beaton2000]. 


# Objectives

The present project therefore aims at (a) developing a Brazilian portuguese translation of the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-16) and Sleep Problem Acceptance Questionnaire (SPAQ), (b) examining its factorial structure, and (c) examining its construct validity.
