# Introduction

Theories of third-wave therapies for insomnia posits that insomnia arises from inability to disengage from information processing. Efforts of metacognitive control prevents the spontaneous processes of relaxation. Rather than controlling, management of insomnia can be made with acceptance of feelings and thoughts associated with insomnia through value-based actions. This work aims to explore which facets of acceptance are related to insomnia severity.

# Methods

Data were collected from online surveys responded by 1376 adults, aged 18 to 59 years, both with and without insomnia symptoms. Participants completed online self-report questionnaires, including, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Sleep Problem Acceptance Questionnaire (SPAQ). Gaussian Graphical Models were estimated using the GLASSO regularization and EBIC model selection. We estimated a network describing the associations among each of the individual items of SPAQ and overall insomnia severity. Node centrality was assessed by strength, closeness, and betweenness.

```

# Conclusion

Three items of SPAQ were particularly strong on the estimated network, namely those concerning controlling sleep problems. This may provide valuable insights to guide third-wave therapies for insomnia.
