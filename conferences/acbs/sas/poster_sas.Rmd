# Introduction

Insomnia symptoms are associated with higher levels of <b><span style="color: #024F84;">metacognitive control</b></span>. Controlled information processing interferes with a healthy sleep process by preventing cognitive deactivation, which involves diminished verbal regulation and control, and acceptance of spontaneous physiological and mental processes. Because general tools for measuring acceptance do not address sleep-related behaviors, the development of specific instruments is essential for studying acceptance of insomnia.

This study aimed to develop a new measure of sleep acceptance, titled Sleep Acceptance Scale (SAS), and examine its factorial structure, internal consistency, and construct validity.

# Methods

The SAS was developed as a 6-item self-report questionnaire rated using a scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always), such that high scores indicate lower sleep acceptance. Data were collected from online surveys responded by 1419 participants, aged 18 to 59 years, with and without insomnia symptoms. We conducted a parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis (with oblimin rotation) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to obtain fit statistics and parameter estimates, using the DWLS estimator.

# Results

The parallel analysis procedure indicated two latent factors: <b><span style="color: #024F84;">Avoidance</b></span> (two items; $\omega$ = .55) and <b><span style="color: #024F84;">Distress</b></span> (four items; $\omega$ = .93). The 2-factor model showed a good fit [$\chi^2$(8) = 59.48, RMSEA = .067 (0.05, 0.084); CFI = .999; RNI = .999; TLI = .998]. 

The SAS was positively correlated with ISI (*r* = .8), DBAS-16 (*r* = .76), AAQ-II (*r* = .63), HADS-A (*r* = .64), HADS-D (*r* = .56), and negatively correlated with SPAQ (*r* = -.63).

# Discussion

Preliminary evidence suggest that the SAS might be a reliable and valid indicator of acceptance of sleep problems in people with and without sleep problems.
